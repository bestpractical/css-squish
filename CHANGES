Revision history for Perl extension CSS::Squish.

    * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
    
      CSS::Squish now searches the user-specified roots _before_ searching
      relative to the importing file.  This seems to make more sense in
      general and allows overriding the default behaviour more easily.
      
      For users not using the multiple roots functionality, behaviour has
      not changed.
