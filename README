NAME
    CSS::Squish - Compact many CSS files into one big file

SYNOPSIS
     use CSS::Squish;
     my $concatenated = CSS::Squish->concatenate(@files);

DESCRIPTION
    This module takes a list of CSS files and concatenates them, making sure
    to honor any valid @import statements included in the files.

    Following the CSS 2.1 spec, @import statements must be the first rules
    in a CSS file. Media-specific @import statements will be honored by
    enclosing the included file in an @media rule. This has the side effect
    of actually *improving* compatibility in Internet Explorer, which
    ignores media-specific @import rules but understands @media rules.

    It is possible that feature versions will include methods to compact
    whitespace and other parts of the CSS itself, but this functionality is
    not supported at the current time.

METHODS
  CSS::Squish->concatenate(@files)
    Takes a list of files to concatenate and returns the results as one big
    scalar.

  CSS::Squish->concatenate_to($dest, @files)
    Takes a filehandle to print to and a list of files to concatenate.
    "concatenate" uses this method with an "open"ed scalar.

  CSS::Squish->roots(@dirs)
    A getter/setter for additional paths to search when looking for imported
    files. The paths specified here are searched _before_ trying to find the
    import relative to the file from which it is imported. This is useful if
    your server has multiple document roots from which your CSS imports
    files and lets you override the default behaviour (but still fall back
    to it).

BUGS AND SHORTCOMINGS
    At the current time, comments are not skipped. This means comments
    happening before @import statements at the top of a file will cause the
    @import rules to not be parsed. Make sure the @import rules are the very
    first thing in the file (and only one per line).

    Only direct @import loops (i.e. where a file imports itself) are checked
    and skipped. It's easy enough to get this module in a loop. Don't do it.

    As of now, server-relative URLs (instead of file-relative URLs) will not
    work correctly.
