=head1 NAME

CSS::Squish - Compact many CSS files into one big file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use CSS::Squish;
 my $concatenated = CSS::Squish->concatenate(@files);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module takes a list of CSS files and concatenates them, making sure
to honor any valid @import statements included in the files.

Following the CSS 2.1 spec, @import statements must be the first rules in
a CSS file.  Media-specific @import statements will be honored by enclosing
the included file in an @media rule.  This has the side effect of actually
I<improving> compatibility in Internet Explorer, which ignores
media-specific @import rules but understands @media rules.

It is possible that feature versions will include methods to compact
whitespace and other parts of the CSS itself, but this functionality
is not supported at the current time.

# This should be a decently close CSS 2.1 compliant parser for @import rules

# XXX TODO: This does NOT deal with comments at all at the moment.  Which
# is sort of a problem.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 B<CSS::Squish-E<gt>concatenate(@files)>

Takes a list of files to concatenate and returns the results as one big scalar.

=head2 B<CSS::Squish-E<gt>concatenate_to($dest, @files)>

Takes a filehandle to print to and a list of files to concatenate.
C<concatenate> uses this method with an C<open>ed scalar.

=head1 BUGS

At the current time, comments are not skipped.  This means comments happening
before @import statements at the top of a file will cause the @import rules
to not be parsed.  Make sure the @import rules are the very first thing in
the file (and only one per line).

All other bugs should be reported via
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=CSS-Squish>
or L<bugs-CSS-Squish@rt.cpan.org>.
